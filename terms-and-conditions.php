                            <p>Thank you for using HappyHolidayss!
                                These Terms of Service (“Terms”) are a binding legal agreement between you
                                and HappyHolidayss that govern your right to use the websites, applications, and other
                                offerings from HappyHolidayss (collectively, the “HappyHolidayss Platform”). When used in these Terms,
                                “HappyHolidayss,” “we,” “us,” or “our” refers to the HappyHolidayss entity set out on Schedule 1 with
                                whom you are contracting. </p>

                            <p>The HappyHolidayss Platform offers an online venue that enables users (“Members”) to publish,
                                offer, search for, and book services. Members who publish and offer services are “Hosts”
                                and Members who search for, book, or use services are “Guests.” Hosts offer
                                accommodations (“Accommodations”), activities, excursions, and events
                                (“Experiences”), and a variety of travel and other services (collectively,
                                “Host Services,” and each Host Service offering, a “Listing”). You must register
                                an account to access and use many features of the HappyHolidayss Platform, and must keep
                                your account information accurate. As the provider of the HappyHolidayss Platform, HappyHolidayss
                                does not own, control, offer or manage any Listings or Host Services. HappyHolidayss is not
                                a party to the contracts entered into directly between Hosts and Guests, nor is
                                HappyHolidayss a real estate broker or insurer. HappyHolidayss is not acting as
                                an agent in any capacity for any Member, except as specified in the Payments
                                Terms of Service (“Payment Terms”).</p>


                            <p>We maintain other terms and policies that supplement these Terms like our Privacy Policy, which describes our collection and use of personal data, and our Payments Terms, which govern any payment services provided to Members by the HappyHolidayss payment entities (collectively "HappyHolidayss Payments"). <br>

                                If you are a Host, you are responsible for understanding and complying with all laws, rules, regulations and contracts with third parties that apply to your Host Services.</p>

                            <p>
                                You can search for Host Services by using criteria like the type of Host Service, travel destination, travel dates, and number of guests. You can also use filters to refine your search results. Search results are based on their relevance to your search and other criteria. Relevance considers factors like price, availability, Reviews, customer service and cancellation history, popularity, previous trips and saved Listings, Host requirements (e.g. minimum or maximum nights), and more.

                            <h5>Booking.</h5>
                            <p>
                                When you book a Listing, you are agreeing to pay all charges for your booking including the Listing price, applicable fees like HappyHolidayss’s service fee, offline fees, taxes, and any other items identified during checkout (collectively, “Total Price”). You are also agreeing that HappyHolidayss via HappyHolidayss Payments may charge the Payment Method (as defined in the Payment Terms) used to book the Listing in order to collect Damage Claim (as defined in Section 15) amounts. When you receive the booking confirmation, a contract for Host Services (a "Reservation") is formed directly between you and the Host. In addition to these Terms, you will be subject to, and responsible for complying with, all terms of the Reservation, including without limitation, the cancellation policy and any other rules, standards, policies, or requirements identified in the Listing or during checkout that apply to the Reservation. It is your responsibility to read and understand these rules, standards, policies, and requirements prior to booking a Listing.Be aware that some Hosts work with a co-host or as part of a team to provide their Host Services.
                            </p>

                            <h5>Accommodation Reservations.</h5>
                            <p>
                                An Accommodation Reservation is a limited license to enter, occupy, and use the Accommodation. The Host retains the right to re-enter the Accommodation during your stay, to the extent: (i) it is reasonably necessary, (ii) permitted by your contract with the Host, and (iii) consistent with applicable law. If you stay past checkout, the Host has the right to make you leave in a manner consistent with applicable law, including by imposing reasonable overstay penalties. You may not exceed the maximum number of allowed Guests.

                            <h5>Cancellations, Travel Issues, and Refunds.</h5>
                            <p>

                                In general, if as a Guest you cancel a Reservation, the amount refunded to you is determined by the cancellation policy that applies to that Reservation. But, in certain situations, other policies take precedence and determine what amount is refunded to you. If something outside your control forces you to cancel a Reservation, you may be eligible for a partial or full refund under our Extenuating Circumstances Policy. If the Host cancels, or you experience a Travel Issue (as defined in our Guest Refund Policy), you may be eligible for rebooking assistance or a partial or full refund under the Guest Refund Policy. Different policies apply to certain categories of Listings; for example Experiences Reservations are governed by the Experiences Guest Refund Policy. See each Additional Legal Term or Policy for details about what is covered, and what refund applies in each situation.

                            <h5>Booking Modifications.</h5>
                            <p>
                                Guests and Hosts are responsible for any booking modifications they agree to make via the HappyHolidayss Platform or direct HappyHolidayss customer service to make on their behalf ("Booking Modifications"), and agree to pay any additional amounts, fees, or taxes associated with any Booking Modification.

                            <h5>Your Responsibilities</h5>
                            <p>
                                You are responsible and liable for your own acts and omissions and are also responsible for the acts and omissions of anyone you invite to join or provide access to any Accommodation, Experience or other Host Service. For example, this means: (i) you are responsible for leaving an Accommodation (and related personal property) in the condition it was in when you arrived, (ii) you are responsible for paying all reasonable Damage Claim amounts necessary to cover damage that you, your guest(s), or your pet(s) cause to an Accommodation, and (iii) you must act with integrity, treat others with respect, and comply with applicable laws at all times. If you are booking for an additional guest who is a minor or if you bring a minor to a Host Service, you must be legally authorized to act on behalf of the minor and you are solely responsible for the supervision of that minor.

                            <h5>Host.</h5>
                            <p>
                            As a Host, Airbnb offers you the right to use the Airbnb Platform to share your Accommodation, Experience, or other Host Service with our vibrant community of Guests - and earn money doing it. It’s easy to create a Listing and you are in control of how you host - set your price, availability, and rules for each Listing. 
                            </p>

                            <h5>Contracting with Guests.</h5>
                            <p>
                            When you accept a booking request, or receive a booking confirmation through the Airbnb Platform, you are entering into a contract directly with the Guest, and are responsible for delivering your Host Service under the terms and at the price specified in your Listing. You are also agreeing to pay applicable fees like Airbnb’s service fee (and applicable taxes) for each booking. Airbnb Payments will deduct amounts you owe from your payout unless we and you agree to a different method. Any terms, policies or conditions that you include in any supplemental contract with Guests must: (i) be consistent with these Terms, our Additional Legal Terms, Policies, and the information provided in your Listing, and (ii) be prominently disclosed in your Listing description.
                            </p>

                            <h5>Independence of Hosts.</h5>
                            <p>
                            Your relationship with Airbnb is that of an independent individual or entity and not an employee, agent, joint venturer, or partner of Airbnb, except that Airbnb Payments acts as a payment collection agent as described in the Payments Terms. Airbnb does not direct or control your Host Service, and you agree that you have complete discretion whether and when to provide Host Services, and at what price and on what terms to offer them.

                            <p>
                            The Airbnb Platform provides tools that make it easy for you to set up and manage a Listing. Your Listing must include complete and accurate information about your Host Service, your price, other charges like cleaning fees, resort fees, offline fees, and any rules or requirements that apply to your Guests or Listing. You are responsible for keeping your Listing information (including calendar availability) and content (like photos) up-to-date and accurate at all times. We recommend that you obtain appropriate insurance for your Host Services and suggest you carefully review policy terms and conditions including coverage details and exclusions. You may only maintain one Listing per Accommodation, but may have multiple Listings for a single property if it has multiple places to stay. Any offer of an Experience is subject to our Additional Terms for Experience Hosts.

                            <h5>Know Your Legal Obligations.</h5>
                            <p>
                            You are responsible for understanding and complying with any laws, rules, regulations, and contracts with third parties that apply to your Listing or Host Services. For example: Some landlords and leases, or homeowner and condominium association rules, restrict or prohibit subletting, short-term rentals and/or longer-term stays. Some cities have zoning or other laws that restrict the short-term rental of residential properties. Some jurisdictions require Hosts to register, get a permit, or obtain a license before providing certain Host Services (such as short-term rentals, longer-term stays, preparing food, serving alcohol for sale, guiding tours, or operating a vehicle). In some places, the Host Services you want to offer may be prohibited altogether. Some jurisdictions require that you register Guests who stay at your Accommodation. Some jurisdictions have laws that create tenancy rights for Guests and additional obligations for Hosts. For example, some places have landlord-tenant, rent control, and eviction laws that may apply to longer stays. Check your local rules to learn what rules apply to the Host Services you plan to offer. Information we provide regarding legal requirements is for informational purposes only and you should independently confirm your obligations. You are responsible for handling and using personal data of Guests and others in compliance with applicable privacy laws and these Terms, including our Host Privacy Standards. If you have questions about how local laws apply you should always seek legal advice.
